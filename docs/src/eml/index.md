# Enshrouded Mod Loader (EML)

EML is a lua-based mod loader and framework for the game Enshrouded.

As of right now, EML is in (somewhat) active development and is not yet complete.
Currently it only supports asset modifications before the game starts, but runtime modifications are planned for the future.
